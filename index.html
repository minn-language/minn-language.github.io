                        <h2 class="journal-subtitle">My Research and What I Learned</h2>
                        <h3 class="journal-text-header">Scanners</h3>
                        <p class="journal-text">I already knew that the 3 basic parts of building a programming language were: creating a scanner, a parser, and some kind of code generation (either interpreter or compiler) but I wanted more detail on each of those parts. The first step on building a programming language is making a scanner, so I decided to focus my research on that. I looked at code examples of scanners and read about the theory behind them to figure out what scanners actually do and learn how to make my own.<br><br>
                        <span id="scanner-explanation">A scanner’s job is to take the code the user types and chunk the text into sections called “tokens” to prepare it for the parser. A token can be a keyword like "<span class="consolas">while</span>" or "<span class="consolas">class</span>"), a number, a symbol <span class="consolas">+ ( ) { } ;</span>, or a string (stored text like “Alex”). The scanner does this by looping through every character in the file and deciding what type of token it belongs to. It checks if a lexeme (chunk of characters, essentially a word) or character is predefined as a keyword or important symbol (like "<span class="consolas">class</span>" as a keyword to define a class, or <span class="consolas">+</span> as a symbol to add 2 numbers, or “ as a symbol to start or end strings) and will make a token of that type (type CLASS or type PLUS). The scanner also has to check for variable names, it does this with regular expressions.</span></p><br>

                        <h3 class="journal-text-header">Regular Expressions</h3>
                        <p class="journal-text">Regular expressions (regex) are a special type programming syntax that can tell if a string meets certain constraints. For example, if you wanted to make sure all variable names in your language start with a lowercase letter or and underscore, then only contain letters and numbers past the first character, regex is very useful.<br><br>

                        <span class="consolas">[a-z_][a-zA-Z0-9]*</span> is the regular expression for the example I explained above.<br><br>
                                
                        The “<span class="consolas">[a-z_]</span>” means the first character of the string must be either “<span class="consolas">a-z</span>” (specifically lowercase) or an “<span class="consolas">_</span>”. The second part of “<span class="consolas">[a-zA-Z0-9]</span>” means the second character can be either “<span class="consolas">a-z</span>” (lowercase letters), “<span class="consolas">A-Z</span>” (uppercase letters), or “<span class="consolas">0-9</span>” (numbers). Finally, the “<span class="consolas">*</span>” at the end of the regular expression is connected to the “<span class="consolas">[a-zA-Z0-9]</span>” and means that “<span class="consolas">[a-zA-Z0-9]</span>” applies to all following characters. Without the “<span class="consolas">*</span>”, the second statement “<span class="consolas">[a-zA-Z0-9]</span>” would only apply to the second character of a string being checked.</p><br>

                        <h3 class="journal-text-header">Enumerator Variables</h3>
                        <p class="journal-text">Earlier I mentioned the scanner will create a token of the correct type when reading the source code of a file. These token types are created using enumerator type variables. In practice, a programmer will create an enumerator object named TokenType and list the different accepted values. Integer types don’t accept values like 5.4, they only accept whole numbers. Enumerator variables can only be an accepted value listed within the object. Below is an example of an enumerator object used for tokens. It lists within it all the accepted values of any TokenType variable.</p>

                        <h3 class="journal-text-header">C Family Distinctions and Syntax</h3>
                        <p class="journal-text">Another area of research I did was C family distinctions and syntax. Just like real languages, programming languages differ from one another in style and practices. C family languages are usually object oriented which means the are suited to a programming style where the programmer makes every part of the program an object with attributes and relationships to other objects (objects in programming can have children or parents, where they inherit or pass on characteristics about themselves).<br><br>

                        C family languages are also usually statically typed, which means all variables have a type when they are declared. Dynamically typed languages (the opposite of statically typed) allow the programmer to make a statement like “var x = 72;” then later change x to a different type like “x = ‘oranges’;”. The programmer just changed x from an integer type to a string type. Statically typed languages don’t let variables change type ever. For example, a statically typed language declares the type when the variable is created: “int x = 72;”. Right there the programmer declared x as an integer by using the int keyword. x can no longer be anything but an integer because it’s not allowed to change types. This statically/dynamically typed distinction affects the syntax of the language because dynamically typed languages just need the var keyword to declare variables but statically typed languages need many keywords for each type such as: bool, string, int, float, etc. When the scanner creates tokens, it creates a token object that has a variable of type TokenType (the enumerator variable we explored earlier) telling us what type of token is (so we know if it’s a value, a keyword, or something else).</p>

                        <p class="journal-text">I achieved all of my goals by the end of the 4 week period, although sometimes out of order (I’ll address this in the next paragraph). I’ve gotten ahead on my research simply because I’m so interested in my project and I’m understanding the concepts quite intuitively. I have been refreshing myself on Java and learning C but I’m considering writing my language in Python due to the easy prototyping and fast development time allowing me to focus more on the concepts of my language. I’ve learned IntelliJ enough to use it but I’m still learning shortcuts to increase productivity. Overall I’m a little ahead of schedule right now and I want to do what I can to maintain that productivity.</p><br>

                        <p class="journal-text">I feel like I need to revise my timeline after getting into my project because I’m going about my research differently. Although I’m achieving my timeline goals each week, the style of my research has changed. When I made my timeline I was planning on doing research on concepts then building it from scratch but I don’t learn well that way. I’ve quickly discovered that I learn very well from looking at examples and reverse engineering them, with supplemental theoretical reading. My current plan for research is to follow along with craftinginterpreters.com’s tutorial learning how to build an interpreter through practice, then go back and make a second interpreter myself from scratch with the knowledge I gained. I’m going to draft a new timeline to revise my schedule, my end accomplishments will be the same but I want to reorganize when I do different aspects of my project. I’m on schedule with my timeline now but soon I might become “off” my timeline even while being productive, simply because I ordered events in my timeline differently that I should have.</p>

                        <p class="journal-text"><span class="consolas">map</span> is a data type in Java I researched this week to help implement the rest of the scanner. The basic form of a map is called a hashmap and is essentially a key/value database for variable values. I’ll use this for multi-character keywords in the language. Single character keywords like <span class="consolas">(</span> and <span class="consolas">+</span> are implemented in the switch case because they aren’t involved in any longer keywords unlike how <span class="consolas">/</span> and <span class="consolas"><</span> are also included in <span class="consolas">//</span> and <span class="consolas"><=</span>. Maps are useful for longer character keywords and I’ll end up using one for longer character keywords (Nystrom). They allow me to input a string and if it’s found in the map, retrieve the correct corresponding value. An example of this can be shown with letter grades and corresponding GPA’s. To a program, the letter A and the number 4 have no inherent connection but with a map, we can create one (Garg).</p>

                        <h3 class="journal-text-header">Java Syntax</h3>
                        <p class="journal-text">Building the scanner requires lots of new syntax for Java that I researched along the way. Maps are declared with the syntax <span class="consolas">Map&lt;keyType, valueType></span> and defined with <span class="consolas">new HashMap<>()</span>. Key and value pairs are then added to the hashmap by using <span class="consolas">mapName.put(key, value)</span> (Garg). I would normally add every key and value pair in the constructor but we can make our code more organized by using static { } with the variable declarations. This just runs a small chunk of static code outside of any method (Nystrom).</p><br>

                        <h3 class="journal-text-header">Python</h3>
                        <p class="journal-text">Because Python is an interpreted and not compiled language, it runs quite a bit slower than Java or C/C++ which are compiled. (<a target="_blank" href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/24558/is-python-interpreted-or-compiled">This StackOverflow Issue</a>). Because I am likely writing an interpreter and not a compiler, I decided to not use Python. I want my interpreter to be reasonably fast and using a slower language to run a slower program will make it much harder for that to happen. I also am already learning necessary Java syntax through the craftinginterpreters tutorial so if I use Java to build my language, I have to do less research into Python syntax.</p>

                            I’ve fallen somewhat behind my goals for this week as a lot of my time was spent not working on my actual project this week. The first Journal I did was graded and passed back so I was reviewing and editing my Journal to make corrections. I also didn’t know that the first Journal was supposed to be 3 weeks long, not 4 weeks so this Journal will be shorter than normal at only 2 real weeks of research/reflection to get back on schedule. I’ve been counting the last week of journal #1 as this journal’s first week.<br>
                            Throughout the second week, I continued with the scanner portion of the craftinginterpreters.com tutorial. As I’ve gone, I’ve continued to learn more Java syntax, more specifically learning about helper methods and string manipulation functions. I do not plan to incorporate Python into my project as it would require extra research into the syntax of the language, whereas I’m constantly learning about Java syntax and scanner implementation at the same time on craftinginterpreters.com. It’s also slower than Java and as I’ll be writing fairly unoptimized code to start, so I don’t want Python slowing down my program anymore than it already may be.<br>
                            During the second week, I finished the scanner tutorial. I am a bit behind and haven’t created my own scanner’s framework as I got distracted working on my website/journals, but I plan to catch up over the long Thanksgiving weekend. I also have my job shadow during the 27th where I plan to ask Mr. Jurow questions about my project and the plans I have for it.

I’m doing all the research ahead of time during the tutorial, then building my own scanner after the tutorial, whereas my initial timeline had me researching a small amount, building a small amount, then researching further, then building further, etc.</p>
